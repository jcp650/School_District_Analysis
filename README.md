# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was tasked by the Chief Data Scientest for a school district for the purpose of analyzing standardized testing data in relation to school size, type and funding. The results of this analysis are designed to reveal trends and patterns that can inform the School Board and District Superintendents about budget decisions at the district and school levels.
